Particle-cli:
To install particle-cli, open your console and run the command npm install particle-cli.

\section{Starting PowerCloud}
\subsection{Firmware}
\subsection{Application Server}
\subsection{Web Server}
To start the PowerCloud Web-Server open the console, redirect to the Web-Server files and run the gulp serve command.
\section{Troubleshoot}
I am getting errors when trying to install through the console.
-Try using sudo before the command. Example: sudo npm install particle-cli

The Web-Server won't run and is giving errors when executing the gulp serve command.
-Make sure you've run npm install and bower install. 
-Make sure you're in the correct directory where the web-server is located.
